ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/de_gcp -C am -b 2048

Your identification has been saved in /Users/alainamartinez/.ssh/de_gcp
Your public key has been saved in /Users/alainamartinez/.ssh/de_gcp.pub

- put public key on gcp

- create VM and find the external IP - 104.155.28.182. use the private key and your user.
ssh -i ~/.ssh/de_gcp am@104.155.28.182

log in and configure the instance - download everything we need.
- download anaconda - use sudo . copy link wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
- download docker

need to add Host to ssh config file 
Host de-zoomcamp
    HostName 104.155.28.182
    User am
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/de_gcp

so now all i have to do is type ssh de-zoomcamp  and i am in.

source .bashrc will restart the ssh so you dont need to login and out.

we can use vscode to connect to the VM!. extension remote ssh. bottom left we can click the remote thing and remote ssh connect to host, choose de-zoomcamp.

add user to be able to run docker without sudo

download docker compose - need to make a new bin directory where all the executaibles will be.
https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.24.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -O docker-compose

execution ability:
chmod +x docker-compose

to make it executable everywhere, not just bin, need to add it to the .bashrc executable.
export PATH="${HOME}/bin:${PATH}"


clone repo

docker-compose up -d (-d means detached)

instal pgcli - pip instal pgcli

pgcli -h localhost -U root -d ny_taxi

\dt shows the schema

now let's be good and use conda 


ctrl ~ opens the terminal!!!

how do we forward the port in the VM locally? 5432?
- we open vscode through ssh, into de-zoomcamp
- we open a terminal and then click ports, and input port 5432

now we open a new terminal and we can simply use port 5432 and it works.
pgcli -h localhost -U root -d ny_taxi

the data isnt in the table in the vm, so i re-ran ingest_data in the VM.
python ingest_data.py \
    --user=root \
    --password=root \
    --host=localhost \
    --port=5432 \
    --db=ny_taxi \
    --table_name=yellow_taxi_trips \
    --url="https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.parquet"

ok now in a local terminal run pgcli -h localhost -U root -d ny_taxi
but error: connection failed: :1), port 5432 failed: could not receive data from server: Connection refused
 do this instead! 
 pgcli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U root -d ny_taxi

 then add 8080 as another port so that we can go to the browser and use pgadmin

then add 8888 port to use jupyter from the terminal. write jupyter notebook and copy link in local browser.

and now we are running the upload-data script so that we can upload the data to the postgres- which i did earlier lol.

the final thing is install tf, inside /bin. 
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.7.1/terraform_1.7.1_linux_amd64.zip
unzip 
sudo apt-get install unzip

we need creds in our VM in order to use our creds. our json file needs to get inside there.
sftp can be used to transfer
creds.json 

sftp de-zoomcamp
mkdir .keys
cd to keys
put creds.json

now 
config gcloud cli credentials
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/.keys/creds.json
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS

now we can terraform init
terraform plan doesnt work bc it cant find the credentials. comment out the creds info from main and it works bc we just authed in.

stop the VM by sudo shutdown now

if you shut it down and restart, you need to copy the new external IP and put it inside .ssh/config
nano .ssh/config and put in hew host in HostName.
